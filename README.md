# üî± AutoStakeHub ü•©

**Autonomous Decentralized Staking Protocol on Stacks**

---

## üí° Overview

`AutoStakeHub` is a fully autonomous and decentralized smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain, designed to manage community staking of the native STX token. It implements a robust, time-locked staking mechanism that rewards users based on their staked amount and chosen lock-up duration, offering different Annual Percentage Yield (APY) tiers to incentivize long-term commitment.

The protocol features automated reward calculations, a transparent claim mechanism, a mandatory lock-in period, and a mechanism for **early withdrawal with a defined penalty**. Furthermore, it introduces an innovative `compound-stake-with-tier-upgrade` function, allowing stakers to reinvest their rewards and potentially upgrade their APY tier by extending their lock-up period, thereby maximizing capital efficiency and compounding returns.

### Key Features

* **Time-Locked Tiers:** Flexible lock periods (30, 90, 180, 365 days) corresponding to escalating APY rates.
* **Decentralized Rewards:** Rewards are calculated continuously based on block height, stake amount, and APY tier.
* **Early Withdrawal Penalty:** A $\mathbf{20\%}$ penalty is applied to the principal for any withdrawal before the lock period expires, reinforcing commitment. The penalty is directed to the contract's reward pool.
* **Compounding & Tier Upgrade:** Users can compound their pending rewards back into their stake, simultaneously selecting a new, longer lock-up period to benefit from a higher APY tier.
* **Emergency Controls:** Owner-only functions for funding the reward pool and toggling an `emergency-pause` mechanism for security.
* **Transparent Accounting:** Read-only functions provide full visibility into individual stake details and protocol-wide statistics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Contract Constants & Configuration

The protocol's economics and operational parameters are defined by the following constants:

| Constant | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `tier-30-days` | `u30` | Minimum lock period (in days). |
| `tier-365-days` | `u365` | Maximum lock period (in days). |
| `apy-30-days` | `u500` | $5.00\%$ APY (500 basis points). |
| `apy-365-days` | `u2000` | $20.00\%$ APY (2000 basis points). |
| `basis-points` | `u10000` | Used for percentage calculations ($100\%$). |
| `blocks-per-day` | `u144` | Approximate average number of Stacks blocks per day. |
| `early-withdrawal-penalty` | `u2000` | $20\%$ penalty on principal for early unstaking (2000 basis points). |

### Error Codes

| Code | Constant | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `u200` | `err-owner-only` | Function restricted to the contract owner. |
| `u201` | `err-not-found` | Staking entry for the principal was not found. |
| `u202` | `err-already-staked` | Sender already has an active stake. (Protocol only allows one active stake per user). |
| `u204` | `err-lock-period-active` | Lock period is either active (for `unstake`) or expired (for `emergency-unstake`). |
| `u205` | `err-no-rewards` | No pending rewards to claim or compound. |
| `u207` | `err-invalid-tier` | Lock-up period does not match a valid tier or is invalid for compounding. |
| `u209` | `err-calculation-error` | An internal calculation resulted in an unexpected error (e.g., overflow). |

## üîí Private Functions (Internal Logic)

Private functions are **internal helpers** that cannot be called directly by external accounts or contracts. They encapsulate core business logic, validation, and calculation routines, making the public interface cleaner and more secure.

### `get-tier-apy`

**(private view: `(get-tier-apy (lock-days uint))` )**

Determines the corresponding Annual Percentage Yield (APY) in basis points for a given lock-up duration, based on the defined tier constants.

* **Parameters:** `lock-days` (`uint`) - The proposed lock-up period (e.g., `u90`).
* **Returns:** `uint` - The APY value (e.g., `u1000` for 10% APY). Returns `u0` if the days don't match a tier.

### `is-valid-tier`

**(private view: `(is-valid-tier (lock-days uint))` )**

Performs validation to check if the provided lock duration matches one of the protocol's configured staking tiers.

* **Parameters:** `lock-days` (`uint`) - The lock-up period to check.
* **Returns:** `bool` - `true` if it's a valid tier (30, 90, 180, or 365 days), `false` otherwise.

### `calculate-rewards-internal`

**(private view: `(calculate-rewards-internal (staker principal))` )**

The core calculation logic. It determines the pending rewards for a specific staker since their `last-claim-block` based on their staked amount, APY tier, and the number of blocks passed.

* **Parameters:** `staker` (`principal`) - The address of the staker.
* **Returns:** `(ok uint)` - The calculated reward amount. Returns `(ok u0)` if no stake is found.

### `is-lock-expired`

**(private view: `(is-lock-expired (staker principal))` )**

Checks the current block height against the stake's `start-block` and `lock-period-days` to determine if the mandatory lock-up period has completed.

* **Parameters:** `staker` (`principal`) - The address of the staker.
* **Returns:** `bool` - `true` if the lock period has expired, `false` otherwise.

## üìö Public Functions (Interface)

### `stake`

**(public fn: `(stake (amount uint) (lock-days uint))` )**

Initiates a new staking deposit.

* **Returns:** `(ok true)` on success.

### `claim-rewards`

**(public fn: `(claim-rewards)` )**

Calculates and distributes all pending rewards to the staker, updating the `last-claim-block`.

* **Returns:** `(ok uint)` the amount of rewards claimed.

### `unstake`

**(public fn: `(unstake)` )**

Withdraws principal and rewards **after** the lock period has expired.

* **Returns:** `(ok uint)` the total amount returned (principal + rewards).

### `emergency-unstake`

**(public fn: `(emergency-unstake)` )**

Withdraws principal **before** lock expiry with a $\mathbf{20\%}$ penalty, which is added to the `reward-pool`. Rewards are forfeited.

* **Returns:** `(ok uint)` the penalty-adjusted principal returned.

### `compound-stake-with-tier-upgrade` üöÄ

**(public fn: `(compound-stake-with-tier-upgrade (additional-lock-days uint))` )**

Reinvests pending rewards, calculates a new principal, resets the lock timer, and potentially upgrades the APY tier.

* **Returns:** `(ok { ... })` a tuple summarizing the compounding action.

## üõ†Ô∏è Administrative Functions

These functions are strictly restricted to the `contract-owner`.

### `fund-reward-pool`

**(public fn: `(fund-reward-pool (amount uint))` )**

Allows the contract owner to manually add STX to the protocol's reward pool.

### `toggle-emergency-pause`

**(public fn: `(toggle-emergency-pause)` )**

Toggles the `emergency-pause` flag, blocking state-mutating functions for security.

## üîç Read-Only Functions (Auditing & Interface)

These functions provide essential data retrieval and calculation utilities for external applications.

### `get-stake-info`

**(read-only fn: `(get-stake-info (staker principal))` )**

## üìê Reward Calculation Logic

The protocol calculates rewards based on a continuous Annual Percentage Yield (APY) model, distributed per block.

The core reward formula is:

$$\text{Reward} = \frac{\text{Stake Amount} \times \text{APY} \times \text{Blocks Passed}}{\text{Basis Points} \times \text{Total Lock Blocks}}$$
